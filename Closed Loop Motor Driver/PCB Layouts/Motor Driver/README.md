__Motor Driver__

This Board receives a pulse like input, similat to a Servo.
The input range is from 0 degrees to 90 degrees for one direction
and 90 to 180 degrees for other direction 
The Board is still under devlopement.
It will be optimised for single sided PCB as to simplify etching and testing at home

A full closed loop RPM control system will be devloped for this
